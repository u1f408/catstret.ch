title: Repurposing a Citrix SD-WAN 410
layout: post
---

recently, on a trip to the local computer recyclers, i saw they had some Citrix-branded rack-mount servers.
i was looking out for little applicance-like rack-mount gear, but wasn't sure what these *were*,
so i popped the lid of one of them off, only to be greeted with a Supermicro logo!

without looking at them too much, i figured they'd be Atoms of some description. a quick search for the
Supermicro part number on the motherboard didn't give me an exact match, but revealed a few similar boards,
all Atoms - and one in particular looked very similar layout-wise. these looked like they'd be useful,
and they were *cheap*, so i brought three of them home, knowing i'd find a use for them.

<!--cut-->

the BIOS in these shows the model identifier as **Citrix SD-WAN 410**, and the Supermicro part number
on the motherboard is **A1SRM-LN7F-CS045**. the closest match i could find on Supermicro's website
is the [A1SRM-LN7F-2758](<https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/motherboard/A1SRM-LN7F-2758>),
but that is shown as having an Atom C2758, but these Citrix boxes have Atom C2558s. close enough.

i removed the SATA DOM and the internal USB flash drive, threw an mSATA SSD in the conveniently-placed
slot, and booted into the debian netinstall media. everything pretty much just worked! one of these
is now running proxmox in my homelab.

i did, however, want to put some more RAM in one of them - and that turned out to be an **ordeal**.
turns out these things are extremely picky, and i could not get it to work with *any* of the spare
DDR3 RAM i had sitting around - varying sizes, rank/layout, both ECC and non-ECC. the only DIMMs
that work thus far were the ones that came in the damn things. unfortunate.

i thought i'd try updating the BIOS to see if that helped any, but then... if i can't find the
board on Supermicro's website, how the hell am i gonna get a BIOS update...?

long story short, the BIOS (and BMC) update images for the A1SRM-LN7F-2758 work just fine.
i've thrown those (and the BIOS updater tool, which runs from an EFI shell) into an archive
and rehosted that, just in case: <https://archive.catstret.ch/dump/A1SRM-LN7F-CS045.tar.gz>
