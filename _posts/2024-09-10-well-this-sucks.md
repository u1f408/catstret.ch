[*"cohost to shut down at end of 2024"*, from the staff blog (archive.org link)](<https://web.archive.org/web/20240909214553/https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down>)

damn. i was using cohost a fair bit, even if only as a read-only "i enjoy looking at these people's posts!" thing.

i guess that means i need to post the things i'm doing here instead, instead of letting them just sit in my cohost drafts?

## irys.cc

the rewrite of those tools is now on the main [irys.cc](<https://irys.cc>) domain, instead of being relegated to beta.irys.cc.
which is good, because the old site was hosted on neocities, which meant i had the ability to just edit the things without any version control.
[it's all in a github repo now.](<https://github.com/u1f408/irys-webby>)

## CatKB

i wrote an "inventory management system" for my boxes and boxes of computer parts. it also does other things (like parcel tracking for a couple NZ courier companies) but those aren't as important.

[the backend](<https://github.com/u1f408/catkb>) is Ruby (using Sinatra for the REST API; and some Rust thrown in for barcode generation), and [the frontend](<https://github.com/u1f408/catkb-web>) is SvelteKit.

it looks terrible, but it damn well works!

## speaking of IBM Power gear...

i got an [IBM Power 710](<https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4983.pdf>) and an [IBM Power 720](<https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp4984.pdf>) recently.

haven't got to play with them much yet, but that'll be fun!

## yeah

i do actually want to try using this damn blog more, but who knows if that'll happen.
there's not much interesting stuff for me to blog about!
